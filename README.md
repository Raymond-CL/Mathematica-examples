## Mathematica Examples

but can we view Mathematica codes on Github? No exactly.
You can only view it by cloning the files to your local PC.
thus the `README` file becomes important.

### alphas

This is just a simple example to plot the value of the running coupling versus the energy scale.
The trend should show that as the scale increases, the coupling strength decreases, satisfying the asymptotic freedom.
- most of the variables are tuneable (color factors fixed), Nf and lambda QCD is variable.
- 1, 2 and 3-loop running coupling expressions are plotted together.
- The fixed data can be found on "Review of Particle Physics" by the "Particle Data Group"
- plot reproduces the result in Figure 9.3 of PTEP, Vol. 2020, No. 8

### glauber

Simple Glauber model in Mathematica
- include Optical and Monte-Carlo Glauber model
- parameters are set to Gold (Au) 197
- visualizations included
